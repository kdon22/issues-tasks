I want all the latest top level incredible tech with offline first and fast fast like linear.

I'll help you build an incredible Linear app clone with the latest tech stack! Let me first review the current project structure and Prisma setup to understand what we're working with.

Excellent! I can see you've got a solid foundation with Next.js 15, React 19, and a comprehensive Prisma schema that already covers users, workspaces, teams, and preferences. The schema looks really well-designed for a Linear clone!

Let me create a comprehensive todo plan to build this into a world-class Linear clone with the latest tech stack:

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive 13-task roadmap to build your Linear clone with the latest tech stack. Here's the modern technology stack I'm recommending:

## ðŸš€ **Cutting-Edge Tech Stack**

### **Core Foundation** (Already Great!)
- âœ… **Next.js 15.3.4** with App Router & Turbopack
- âœ… **React 19** with concurrent features
- âœ… **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling
- âœ… **Prisma** with solid schema foundation

### **New Additions for Linear-Level Performance**
- **State Management**: Zustand + TanStack Query (React Query v5)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Radix UI primitives
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js)
- **Real-time**: WebSockets/Pusher for live collaboration
- **Offline-First**: Service Worker + IndexedDB/Dexie.js
- **Validation**: Zod for end-to-end type safety
- **Search**: Fuse.js for lightning-fast local search
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth interactions
- **Icons**: Lucide React (Linear uses custom icons)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Linear-Inspired Features**
- **Blazing Fast Navigation** with keyboard shortcuts
- **Instant Search** with fuzzy matching
- **Real-time Collaboration** with live cursors
- **Offline-First Architecture** with smart sync
- **Command Palette** (Cmd+K) for power users
- **Drag & Drop** for issue management
- **Rich Text Editor** for descriptions
- **Smart Notifications** system

## ðŸ”¥ **Performance Optimizations**
- **React 19 Concurrent Features** for smooth UX
- **Virtualization** for large lists
- **Optimistic Updates** for instant feedback
- **Smart Caching** with TanStack Query
- **Code Splitting** for fast initial loads
- **Service Worker** for offline capability

The todo list is structured with proper dependencies, so we can work systematically. Your Prisma schema is already excellent - it covers users, workspaces, teams, and preferences perfectly!

Ready to start building? Which task should we tackle first? I'd recommend starting with **database-setup** to extend your schema with Issues, Projects, and Labels, then move to **ui-foundation** to get the visual foundation right.
